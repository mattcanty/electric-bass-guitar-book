							<h2>Freddie Thompson</h2>
							<p>Testimonial by professional bass player</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							My bass playing background is primarily steeped in Gospel music. I first picked up the bass at the age of 13. 
							After about four years of playing I was regarded as possessing a certain amount of raw talent. However, I 
							knew I did not really have solid technique and that, if I was to pursue bass playing seriously, this had 
							to be addressed.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 1982 I purchased a copy of Laurence Canty's Electric Bass Guitar. It transformed my approach, my 
							confidence in navigating around the instrument and my playing through any chord changes. Later, I 
							had the opportunity to have lessons with Laurence. He taught me how expand on what I had learnt from 
							the book, and how to practise reading music.
						</p>
						<p>
							30 years later, with a career involving many tours and recordings, I decided it was time to revisit 
							my technique and make sure it was as solid as it should be. I'd read many instructional books over 
							the years, but there was one that was the foundation of my technique - Electric Bass Guitar. I knew 
							I wouldn't still have the original book, so I browsed the internet and ordered the new and updated edition.
						</p>
						<p>
							It has been a pleasure just to go through the exercises again, discovering where I had acquired bad 
							habits, and addressing them. Also, remembering Laurence's simple but very effective way of teaching 
							scales and chord studies, gave me the confidence to pursue my own journey. To me this book is the bass 
							instructional book.
						</p>
						<p>
							Freddie Thompson has worked with the likes of Westlife, M People, Deniece Williams, Gloria Gaynor, 
							Chaka Khan, George Michael, Tom Jones and J-Lo to name but a few.

							<h2>Yolanda Charles</h2>
							<p>Foreword by Laurence Canty's ex-pupil</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							I met Laurence when I had been playing bass for a year. During our relaxed lessons, he shared 
							with me his approach to becoming a good bass player and it's all here in his book. I've found 
							knowledge of theory and the construction of chords invaluable. My technique, developed with 
							Laurence's guidance, has helped me to avoid any physical problems such as RSI. Attention to 
							the actual sound I was making, note-length, string muting and how the right hand influences 
							the overall sound, have added much to my playing and musicianship. This awareness has helped 
							me succeed as a professional musician.
						</p>
						<p>
							The book starts by emphasising the importance of understanding the instrument and how to 
							practise comfortably. It explains the patterns and 'shortcuts' to enable you to get around 
							the neck, and become 'gig ready' within weeks. The more advanced player will find notated 
							exercises, harmonic ideas and technique suggestions, which all add to a greater understanding 
							of the bass.

							<h2>Colin Greenwood</h2>

						<p>
							I've been playing bass with Radiohead since its inception. I'm into the space a bass can
							occupy between the drums and the harmonies of guitar and voice, and how the instrument can 
							become part of the soul of the band. After recording 'The Bends' in 1994, I decided that 
							I wanted to find out more about the instrument. I was lucky enough to have a series of 
							lessons with Laurence, using his book 'Electric Bass Guitar'. The book helped me to understand 
							the freedom that harmony and chord theory can give a bass player. It also helped reinforce 
							and develop what I already knew about rhythm and technique. One of the books many strengths 
							is that it can be used by any player, at any level; it is a very clear, concise introduction 
							to the instrument. It has been repeatedly useful to me over the years, across several tours 
							and albums, in fact, the bass line on Airbag (the first track of 'OK Computer') was the 
							result of a lesson on chord theory with Laurence. I'm still using this supportive, challenging, 
							and confidence-inspiring book for tuition and reference.
