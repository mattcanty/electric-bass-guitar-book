								<h3>Brief History</h3>
								<p>
									Laurence Canty bought his first bass while still at school. He was rehearsing with a 
									band within two weeks and on stage soon after. He studied at Lancaster University, 
									formed a band and returned to London to seek fame and fortune.
								</p>
								<p>He started teaching bass, first privately and then also at Goldsmiths College, University 
									of London, and gradually moved into freelance playing, everything from night clubs and 
									theatres to radio and television. He has contributed articles to Bass Player in the US 
									and Bassist in the UK. He wrote a monthly column called 'Bass Case' in the magazine 
									'Making Music' and co-wrote the book 'What Bass' with Tony Bacon. Today, Laurence is 
									one of the most respected figures in the UK bass tuition World.
								</p>
								<h3>Earlier Versions</h3>
								<h4>1978, Electric Bass Guitar - A Complete Guide</h4>
								<p>
									I had started giving private lessons in 1974 and the idea of a book soon occurred. 
									Then, in December 1975, Stuart McGowan, a guitarist I had played with at Lancaster 
									University, told me that Chappell's were interested in publishing a bass tutor. 
									However, in a February 1976 meeting, they revealed that they might translate a French 
									tutor they already published. Then, in July, they decided to proceed with my book, 
									and the contract was signed. The original draft was hand-written in a week during 
									an August break in Lancaster. It was typed and delivered on time at the beginning 
									of October, just as I was starting to teach bass at Goldsmith's College, the class
									had been started by Mo Foster the previous year. There was then a long delay before 
									it was published in December 1978, although this did allow for various additions, 
									with the basic rhythm patterns being included at the last moment. The book was 
									entirely designed and illustrated by John Stoddard. Its modern look was very different 
									from other music books of the time.
								</p>
								<h4>1984, How to Play Bass Guitar</h4>
								<p>
									Chappell's had merged with EMI to become IMP. In 1983 IMP and Elm Tree Books wanted 
									a bass book as part of a How to series. This provided an opportunity to revise and 
									make additions. The work was typed during a summer season on the Isle of Man and 
									published in 1984. It also appeared in French and Spanish translations.
								</p>
								<h4>1990, Electric Bass Guitar - The Complete Guide</h4>
								<p>
									After convincing IMP that it was time for a new revised, improved and enlarged edition; 
									it emerged in 1990. The previous text was typed into a word processor and then the 
									changes were made. The new material was inspired by the variety of freelance playing 
									I had been involved in and this book formed the basis of my teaching, especially for 
									the classes at Goldsmith's College where I continued teaching until 1997 and required 
									that this information was presented as clearly and simply as possible.
								</p>
								<h4>2009, The New Electric Bass Guitar - The Complete Guide </h4>
								<p>
									Once the previous version was out of print, I was able to regain my copyright. So in 
									2008, thirty years on from the original publication, and back in Lancaster, I started 
									working on this new version which was published in December 2009. Now the whole process 
									is computerised, from the writing to design and printing. The original drawings (which 
									were created from photos) have been replaced by photos. A consistent feature has been 
									the bass on the front cover. When built in 1976 by John Diggins (of John Birch Guitars) 
									it was all maple. On the latest cover, it now has an ash body and ebony fingerboard, 
									both by Dave Wild (of Wild Guitars). The new book now comes with a CD and after many 
									discussions with the printers, the book is printed with a wrap around (Half-Canadian 
									bound) cover and spiral rings allowing pages to sit flat on a music stand.
